Beginner:
- This is our first hackathon

## Inspiration
Chefs are one of the few groups of professionals that have realized the importance of a farmer-consumer relationship and have expressed it through what they both share a love for: food. In our discussion of attempting to bridge that gap, the team began to brainstorm how else this idea would benefit both groups of people. The benefits were endless in all three pillars of sustainability  (profit, people, and planet) for these two groups of people! Cultivate would be the first social media app made for farmers to have a closer reach to consumers.  it would empower farmers by providing them a place to access different resources, encourage farmers to promote themselves through

## What it does
At its core, CULTIVATE is a social media web app that empowers farmers by providing them an area to take control of their own narrative, and support them with an area to find resources that help them pragmatically with adopting more sustainable methods in their farming practices. Our project's objective is to help farmers get resources, news, and articles, and communicate with other farmers to get ideas and knowledge of more sustainable ways to address issues on their farms. They can also connect with different kinds of clients to sell their own fresh, local produce and raise awareness for events they might be involved in. Alternatively, the website also helps clients who are want to buy food they trust and directly connect with farmers.

## How we built it
To create a website for this project, "Three" main steps are needed. 
+ Wireframe by utilizing [Figma](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjt6JPTw8T9AhVeKEQIHb_ZDtkQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Flogin&usg=AOvVaw0-_hnR6xZSo5TU8dTslQK8) to arrange and preview of the website before making a real website
+ Coding in HTML, CSS in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to make the website look more like more powerful in visualization.
+ Collecting and managing databases and make the webpages more interactive and interesting by deploying [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  and [React](https://reactjs.org).

## Challenges we ran into
As a team of first time hackers who are unfamiliar with coding environments and specific softwares, our team found a lot of hurdles in handling each and every part of the project. Specifically,
+ In using [Figma](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjt6JPTw8T9AhVeKEQIHb_ZDtkQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Flogin&usg=AOvVaw0-_hnR6xZSo5TU8dTslQK8) when designing for the preview of webpages, manual adjustments of sizes and the tedious nature of it was one of the more difficult parts for those of us beginning to learn about the software development process.
+ A lot of time was taken in teaching teammates how to code in HTML and CSS which ended up in an uneven workload.
+ An earnest effort was made to imagine and replicate on a small scale what kind of database a large social media app would demand and implement it through React and Node.js. Still, with a large number of the team being unfamiliar with both, the effort needed to make the website successful tripled.
+ Feasibilities, scalabilities, and maintenance of benefits on farmers and clients had to be considered in all features of webpages throughout the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Everyone in the team is proud of sticking to the hurdles of a tough sustainability theme-based project even though we all are naive and beginners. We are especially proud of the great idea that came out this and the passion that drove it.

## What we learned
### Sustainability Theme
Because of soil degradation, floods, and storms, a great amount of crops and fruits on farms being lost was perceived and if it is not carefully contained under control with more sustainable techniques, **Great Starving** would probably break out.

### Technical Theme
As a beginner hacker team, we learned web development and design skills in creating a real website for farmers and consumers.

## What's next for CULTIVATE
We are planning to expand the webpage with more features and bigger database to sustain more users.
